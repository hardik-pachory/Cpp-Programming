# Wholesale Market Management System
The project uses BGI and hence it is preferable to use Turbo C++ to run the project. "Items.txt" is nothing but data base of items that are available in the shop. C++ File Handeling is 
done to store the data. It is based on OOP concept and is successfully implimented. It is a CLI project with which little graphics are added just for fun.
